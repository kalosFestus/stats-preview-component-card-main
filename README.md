## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* CSS Flexbox


### What I learned

* I improved on my knowledge and use css flexbox and media queries in making responsive designs for different device screens.
* I improved on my knowledge in using and combining background properties and making image overlays
* I learnt how to use the `<picture>` tag and also how to define width for both image and container.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on responsive designs and better code writing in my future projects while also mastering CSS Flexbox and its properties.
